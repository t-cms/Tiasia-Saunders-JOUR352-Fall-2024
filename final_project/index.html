                        Candace Fails screamed for someone in the Texas hospital to help her pregnant daughter. “Do
                        something,” she pleaded, on the morning of Oct. 29, 2023. Nevaeh Crain was crying in pain, too
                        weak to walk, blood staining her thighs. Feverish and vomiting the day of her baby shower, the
                        18-year-old had gone to two different emergency rooms within 12 hours, returning home each time
                        worse than before. The first hospital diagnosed her with strep throat without investigating her
                        sharp abdominal cramps. At the second, she screened positive for sepsis, a life-threatening and
                        fast-moving reaction to an infection, medical records show. But doctors said her six-month fetus
                        had a heartbeat and that Crain was fine to leave. Now on Crain’s third hospital visit, an
                        obstetrician insisted on two ultrasounds to “confirm fetal demise,” a nurse wrote, before moving
                        her to intensive care. By then, more than two hours after her arrival, Crain’s blood pressure
                        had plummeted and a nurse had noted that her lips were “blue and dusky.” Her organs began
                        failing. <strong>Hours later, she was dead.</strong>

                        Fails and Crain believed abortion was morally wrong. The teen could only support it in the
                        context of rape or life-threatening illness, she used to tell her mother. They didn’t care
                        whether the government banned it, just how their Christian faith guided their own actions.

                    <p>
                        When they discovered Crain was pregnant with a girl, the two talked endlessly about the little
                        dresses they could buy, what kind of mother she would be. Crain landed on the name Lillian.
                        Fails could not wait to meet her. But when her daughter got sick, Fails expected that doctors
                        had an obligation to do everything in their power to stave off a potentially deadly emergency,
                        even if that meant losing Lillian. In her view, they were more concerned with checking the fetal
                        heartbeat than attending to Crain.

<li>Clinic Closures: Numerous clinics in restrictive states closed, reducing access to reproductive healthcare broadly.</li>
<li>Legal Uncertainty: Confusion around exceptions (e.g., for rape, incest, or maternal health) led to delays or denials of necessary care.</li>

                <p>Crain had just graduated from high school in her hometown of Vidor, Texas, in May of 2023 when she learned that she was pregnant.

She and her boyfriend of two years, Randall Broussard, were always hip to hip, wrestling over vapes or snuggling on the couch watching vampire movies. Crain was drawn to how gentle he was. He admired how easily she built friendships and how quickly she could make people laugh. Though they were young, they’d already imagined starting a family. Broussard, who has eight siblings, wanted many kids; Crain wanted a daughter and the kind of relationship she had with her mom. Earlier that year, Broussard had given Crain a small diamond ring — “a promise,” he told her, “that I will always love you.”


On the morning of their baby shower, Oct. 28, 2023, Crain woke with a headache. Her mom decorated the house with pink balloons and Crain laid out Halloween-themed platters. Soon, nausea set in. Crain started vomiting and was running a fever. When guests arrived, Broussard opened gifts — onesies and diapers and bows — while Crain kept closing her eyes.

Around 3 p.m., her family told her she needed to go to the hospital.

Broussard drove Crain to Baptist Hospitals of Southeast Texas. They sat in the waiting room for four hours. When Crain started vomiting, staff brought her a plastic pan. When she wasn’t retching, she lay her head in her boyfriend’s lap.


A nurse practitioner ordered a test for strep throat, which came back positive, medical records show. <strong>But in a pregnant patient, abdominal pain and vomiting should not be quickly attributed to strep </strong>, physicians told ProPublica; a doctor should have also evaluated her pregnancy.

Instead, Baptist Hospitals discharged her with a prescription for antibiotics. She was home at 9 p.m. and quickly dozed off, but within hours, she woke her mother up. <strong>“Mom, my stomach is still hurting,” she said into the dark bedroom at 3 a.m. “I’m in a lot of pain.”</strong></p>

                    <p>Fails drove Broussard and Crain to another hospital in town, Christus Southeast Texas St. Elizabeth. Around 4:20 a.m., OB-GYN William Hawkins saw that Crain had a temperature of 102.8 and an abnormally high pulse, according to records; a nurse noted that Crain rated her abdominal pain as a seven out of 10.

<strong>Her vital signs pointed to possible sepsis,</strong> records show. It’s standard medical practice to immediately treat patients who show signs of sepsis, which can overtake and kill a person quickly, medical experts told ProPublica. These patients should be watched until their vitals improve. Through tests and scans, the goal is to find the source of the infection. If the infection was in Crain’s uterus, the fetus would likely need to be removed with a surgery.

In a room at the obstetric emergency department, a nurse wrapped a sensor belt around Crain’s belly to check the fetal heart rate. “Baby’s fine,” Broussard told Fails, who was sitting in the hallway.

<strong>After two hours of IV fluids, one dose of antibiotics, and some Tylenol, Crain’s fever didn’t go down, her pulse remained high, and the fetal heart rate was abnormally fast, medical records show. Hawkins noted that Crain had strep and a urinary tract infection, wrote up a prescription and discharged her.</strong>

Hawkins had missed infections before. Eight years earlier, the Texas Medical Board found that he had failed to diagnose appendicitis in one patient and syphilis in another. In the latter case, the board noted that his error “may have contributed to the fetal demise of one of her twins.” The board issued an order to have Hawkins’ medical practice monitored; the order was lifted two years later. (Hawkins did not respond to several attempts to reach him.)

<strong>All of the doctors who reviewed Crain’s vital signs for ProPublica said she should have been admitted. “She should have never left, never left,”</strong> said Elise Boos, an OB-GYN in Tennessee.

Kass, the New York emergency physician, put it in starker terms: When they discharged her, they were “pushing her down the path of no return.”

“It’s bullshit,” Fails said as Broussard rolled Crain out in a wheelchair; she was unable to walk on her own. Fails had expected the hospital to keep her overnight. <strong>Her daughter was breathing heavily, hunched over in pain, pale in the face. Normally talkative, the teen was quiet.</strong>
