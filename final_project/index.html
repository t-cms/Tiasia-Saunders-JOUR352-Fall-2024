                        Candace Fails screamed for someone in the Texas hospital to help her pregnant daughter. “Do
                        something,” she pleaded, on the morning of Oct. 29, 2023. Nevaeh Crain was crying in pain, too
                        weak to walk, blood staining her thighs. Feverish and vomiting the day of her baby shower, the
                        18-year-old had gone to two different emergency rooms within 12 hours, returning home each time
                        worse than before. The first hospital diagnosed her with strep throat without investigating her
                        sharp abdominal cramps. At the second, she screened positive for sepsis, a life-threatening and
                        fast-moving reaction to an infection, medical records show. But doctors said her six-month fetus
                        had a heartbeat and that Crain was fine to leave. Now on Crain’s third hospital visit, an
                        obstetrician insisted on two ultrasounds to “confirm fetal demise,” a nurse wrote, before moving
                        her to intensive care. By then, more than two hours after her arrival, Crain’s blood pressure
                        had plummeted and a nurse had noted that her lips were “blue and dusky.” Her organs began
                        failing. <strong>Hours later, she was dead.</strong>

                        Fails and Crain believed abortion was morally wrong. The teen could only support it in the
                        context of rape or life-threatening illness, she used to tell her mother. They didn’t care
                        whether the government banned it, just how their Christian faith guided their own actions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When they discovered Crain was pregnant with a girl, the two talked endlessly about the little
                        dresses they could buy, what kind of mother she would be. Crain landed on the name Lillian.
                        Fails could not wait to meet her. But when her daughter got sick, Fails expected that doctors
                        had an obligation to do everything in their power to stave off a potentially deadly emergency,
                        even if that meant losing Lillian. In her view, they were more concerned with checking the fetal
                        heartbeat than attending to Crain.
