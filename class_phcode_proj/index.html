        <p>
            Four years after the January 6th insurrection, President Donald Trump pledged to pardon more than a thousand
            participants, among them, dozens from Maryland. Of the 46 Marylanders charged in connection with the attack,
            32 came from counties that voted overwhelmingly for Joe Biden. </p> 
        <p>This trend of a higher number of January 6th
            participants coming from blue counties is understandable, as Maryland's blue counties tend to have larger
            populations. With more people living in these areas, it’s statistically likely that a greater number of
            individuals from these regions would be involved in the insurrection, regardless of their political
            affiliation.</p>
        <p>“It is not difficult to come from a blue county in Maryland, but I think it might have made
            right-wingers feel angry. Being surrounded by not just Democrats for many cases, but liberal Democrats, and
            places like Montgomery, Howard, and Baltimore counties,” Matthew Crenson, a professor emeritus of political
            science at Johns Hopkins University, said.</p>
        <p>“So they may have, because they were exposed to unfriendly,
            hostile, political opinions; they may have been induced to become hostile themselves, and that may have
            driven them to travel to Washington on January 6th,” he continued.</p>
        <p>This sense of political isolation is not
            unique to Maryland but is part of a larger, national trend where individuals in politically homogeneous
            environments can become more entrenched in their beliefs, sometimes to the point of radicalization.
            According to the Becker Friedman Institute report, this isolation creates an aggressive mentality, where
            individuals who feel marginalized by the dominant political culture around them may seek out violent ways to
            express their frustrations.</p>
        <p>Additionally, this sense of alienation is not confined to rural or conservative
            areas; in fact, it can thrive even in more liberal environments. </p>
        <p>"Yeah. I think, unfortunately, that has
            been the case, right? Because of, especially because of the internet, like, it's not just that we see,
            unfortunately, Neo Nazis in like Southern, deep red states, like, you know, there was, like, a neo Nazi
            group that wanted to make a white ethno state in, like, Maine, right? Like they exist in very blue places
            too,” Jon Lewis, a a Research Fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said.  </p>
        <p>In Maryland, particularly in the state's urban and suburban areas, where liberal policies
            often dominate, some right-leaning individuals might have felt alienated or even demonized by the
            progressive views of their neighbors. This sense of alienation could have fueled a desire to make a
            political statement, culminating in the violent actions on January 6th.
